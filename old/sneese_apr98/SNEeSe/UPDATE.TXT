Major changes
-------------
More precalculating in screen renderer
IRQ disable and 'missed' IRQ support
Sprite Priority Rotation corrected (Mario status sprite works!)

Notes
-----
There are several lines of commented code in several locations, and
one macro that isn't commented out... do NOT enable this... it is
there only for use with the DMA dump, which requires modifications to
main.cc...
