Memory addresses labeled as [SHADOWED] are just areas of memory which are
supposed to be the same as the Master Area (which is labeled [*MASTER*]).

Programs that are shadowed can usually be executed there in the high-speed
mode.

Interesting thing is that in LoROM, the Save RAM is 256 KB. However in
HiROM, the Save RAM is 128K. According to our sources, this is correct.

                       MODE 20 (LoROM - 32 KB Banks)
                 RESET, BRK, NMI should point to Bank $00
