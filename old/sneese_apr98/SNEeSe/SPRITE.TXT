Notes on: spriteL.S

Finally... converted all 32x32 and 64x64 sprite plotters to the same new
format of the 8x8 and 16x16 tile plotters... the new spriteL.S requires
the new tilesL.S to function... and the (RENDER_SPRITE) sprite renderers
are rewritten... and sprites are no-longer misclipped onto left-side...

The problem with clipping was, when a sprite was checked that had an X
position of 0x100, the low byte of zero was being subtracted, and the
result in this case is always zero, so the sprite, which shouldn't be
on the screen in the first place (just off by the right border) is
drawn at position 0 (just on by the left border). I got the idea by
looking at the code which checks if the sprite is on the current
scanline... it has the potential of having the same problem (with
worse symptoms), but you obviously caught that one...

It's a little easy to get confused by the new code, but it's fine once
you get used to it... most of it is in macro's, that could be redone...
I did it that way so I could optimize and debug it all at once, since
it was all practically the same code in the first place...
