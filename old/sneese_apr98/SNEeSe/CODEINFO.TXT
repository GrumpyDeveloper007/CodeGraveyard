 SNEeSe Source Release V0.14 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 Just a quick explanation of this code :

 It is upto date as of release 0.14, I will of course update it soon.

 The biggest addition, the SPC code in a reasonable state, it is now
mostly macro-ised and it works under Mario. ;-)

 If DJGPP crashes during compilation of any .S file don't panic just
re-run it, its a problem with macro expansion in the assembler.

 A lot of commented code is redundant in this release, but some may be
useful later on so I have left it. You must have a directory structure
that looks like this :


\SNEESE
\DJGPP
      \ALLEGRO

 ALLEGRO is usually installed within DJGPP's directory so it should be
no problem?

 ALLEGRO is used even more in this release, I like it, if you don't
then I suggest you start. Its saves me work which is what I need at present.
A lot of code in various modules has changed. A new file called memhi.s
exists and contains most of the hirom mapping stuff (not all of it!).

 If you find this code useful a mention might be nice ;)
 I will always help people struggling to write emulators for SNES,
especially those who are writing for other than IBM so you can email
me on :

        savoury.snax@usa.net

 I will be putting up my own docs on snes on the homepage WHEN I GET TIME!
