True Or Falce Facts About Snes96sp

Lots of ppl had asked me lots of questions on IRC. So here are facts
and fictions about Snes96sp or Sn2.

True:

-It speeds up Snes96 Emulation Speed
-It is made in **********.
-It use some frames
-It was NOT made from bat2exec or exe2com, or any other re-assembling
 programs.
-I am NOT the person who made Snes96 or Snes97.
-There MIGHT be a speed patch for GenEmu.
-It was made by R^pper (me).

False: -All miths about Snes96

-It was made from bat2exec

What this program does:
 This is a Snes96 FrontEnd Utility. It looks at your CPU speed and when you
pick "detect" option it adjustes Snes96 frame skipping to the best possible
option to be compatible with your pc. I AM STILL NOT GIVING SOURCE CODES TO
ANYONE. This program is NOT any part of Snes96. And to all those people who
asked me "This was NOT made by bat2exec !" Here's the proof. It's ONLY 1 file.
It has a VGA logo (NOT POSSIBLE TO MAKE IN A .bat FILE). It has OPTION MENU.
Not the corny "choice" Proof -Over here you can tipe in commands, and select
menus. In the corny "choice" command you can only pick "A B C D E F G H, etc.."
To others who asked me "will you continue with your work ?" And the answer is
"yes I am, and I will continue to make other utils for other emulators". To
get them you can contact me on IRC in EFNet, my nick is usualy R^pper and I am
an op on #EmuLand . Any questions, comments /msg me.
 Joystic Support files are copyrighted By JoyEmu 3.3, SZP. I am not the maker 
of nether JoyEmu or Snes96. Just this little front end utility.
