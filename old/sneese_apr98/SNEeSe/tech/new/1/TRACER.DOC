Introduction
------------
TRaCER is a disassembler that takes assembled/compiled 65c816 code for
the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), and converts it into
valid, re-useable source code.  TRaCER was originally written to become
a 65c816 realtime debugger, but due to the desire for a decent PC 65c816
disassembler, it became what it is now.

My experiences with PC disassemblers such as DSFX and DISASM v2.0 were
not good ones.

DSFX's disassembled results were not easily re-useable by most assemblers
such as Tricks Assembler and x816. Plus, it couldn't handle stack-relative
operators such as "LDA ($C8,Y),S" or such simple things as "MVN $01, $00".
This bothered me, as I originally learned 6502/65c816 on the Apple II, the
original home for the 65xxx series processor. I really *REALLY* hate when
people don't follow the standard 65c816 syntax that William D. Mensch, Jr.
originally created.

DISASM v2.0, despite being efficient and having many options which I found
useful, did not run under an MSDOS window via Windows 95 due to DPMI
limitations. And to add to the disappointment, it was horribly slow.

Even though I totally respect the amount of time and effort put into making
DSFX and DISASM v2.0, my own desires finally made me give in, and so it be-
came that I wrote TRaCER.

TRaCER is no longer Shareware! I felt the Shareware fee was fair, but I
found that no one was registering it. Why charge and make people feel
guilty when you can make *EVERYONE* happy? :-)

Here are some features which will be incorporated into TRaCER during it's
growth:
     * HiROM support
     * Pseudo-op support (BLT, BGE, JML, TAD, TAS, TDA, TSA, SWA, etc.)
     * Three-pass optimization
     * Code vs. data distinguishment
     * Subroutine and branch labelling
     * Subroutine tracing (multi-pass)
     * Cycle counting
     * Commenting for NES & SNES registers


Using TRaCER
------------
To disassemble binaries, simply type 'TRACER' following by the filename of
the binary you wish to disassemble, and press <Enter>. There are a few
command-line options you can use which modify the output of the disassembly.
Below is a summary of the options available.

Usage: TRaCER [-abfiknorstv] [file]

Options:
Options:
     -a: 16-bit accumulator
     -b: Disassemble from NMI/VBL vector
     -f: Trace SEP/REP sizing
     -i: 16-bit index registers
     -k: Skip iNES header
     -n: NES (65C02) compatible output
     -o: Output to file 'OUTPUT.DIS'
     -r: Real 65c816 addressing mode
     -s: Skip SMC/SWC header
     -t: TrueSource output
     -v: Disassemble from reset vector

The amount of command-line options are very miniscule right now. All of
the above options are initially disabled; to enable any of them, simply
include the command itself before the filename (e.g. TRACER -s FILE.SMC).

Once given a proper binary file, TRaCER will begin to disassemble the
file, sending all disassembled output to standard out. It can be re-
directed to a file via standard DOS syntax (TRaCER FILE.SMC > OUTPUT).
Control-Break is ignored, but Control-C (^C) may be used in the middle of
operation to stop TRaCER prematurely.

Here is a small explanation of what each command-line option does.

-a: 16-bit accumulator
       This sets the accumulator's default size to 16-bits.
       [Default is 8-bit]
-b: Disassemble from NMI/VBL vector
       This option will start disassembly at whatever the SNES image's
       NMI/VBL vector is. This is found at file-offset $7FFA (add 512 bytes
       for a .SMC image). If used in conjunction with the -v option, which-
       ever option is defined LAST in the command-line will be used.
       [Default is off]
-i: 16-bit index registers
       Same as -a, except for the index registers.
       [Default is 8-bit]
-k: Skip iNES header
       This option skips the first 16 bytes of the file, avoiding the
       standard interNES header. Very useful for examining code which has
       the .NES extension.
       [Default is off]
-n: NES (65C02) compatible output
       This option turns on 65c02 support, and disabled 65c816 opcodes.
       All opcodes which are unknown for the 65c02 chipset will be labelled
       as '???'.
       [Default is off]
-o: Output to file 'OUTPUT.DIS'
       This option will send all disassembled output to a file called
       'OUTPUT.DIS'. Otherwise, results will be written directly to the
       screen. Yes, you may consider this option useless if you do some-
       thing like: TRACER -F -S DEMO.SMC > OUTPUT.DIS :-).
       [Default is off]
-r: Real 65C816 addressing mode
       This option allows standard LoROM disassembly to be turned off,
       allowing the PC (program counter) to be reset to $0000 instead of
       $8000 (as the Super Nintendo requires for LoROM disassembly).
       Default is off.
       [Default is off]
-s: Skip SMC/SWC header
       This option skips the first 512 bytes of the file, avoiding the
       standard Super Magicom/Super Wildcard header. Very useful for ex-
       amining code which has the .SMC or .SWC extension.
       Default is off.
       [Default is off]
-t: TrueSource output
       This option turns on "TrueSource" output; the current bank, PC,
       and hex-values will not be shown, allowing for code to be re-
       assembled without too many problems.
       [Default is off]
-v: Disassemble from reset vector
       This option will start disassembly at whatever the SNES image's
       reset vector is. This is found at file-offset $7FFC (add 512 bytes
       for a .SMC image). This is useful for certain games, such as Kemco's
       "Lagoon". If used in conjunction with the -b option, whichever option
       is defined LAST in the command-line will be used.
       [Default is off]
-f: Trace REP/SEP sizing
       This allows the disassembler to follow REP/SEP opcodes which change
       the size of the accumulator and X/Y index registers during execution.
       If used, all operands which use immediate values will take note of
       the sizes of each register independantly. Initially, A/X/Y are 8 bit.

       Example source:

              SEP #$30
              LDA #$8F
              STA $2100
              REP #$10
              LDX #$00FF
              LDA #$2A
              SEP #$10

       TRaCER with the -f option enabled will disassemble the above code
       exactly how it is shown above, while DISASM v2.0 and DSFX will show
       the following:

              SEP #$30
              LDA #$8F
              STA $2100
              REP #$10
              LDX #$FF     ; Error occurs here.
              BRK $A9
              ROL
              SEP #$10

       [Default is off]


Technical Notes
---------------
TRaCER is written in Borland Pascal v7.0 (protected-mode), with assembly
subroutines/functions to achieve ultimate speed and efficiency.

Minor error checking is performed at this time.

History
-------
TRaCER started out originally as a PC 65c816 debugger (i.e. realtime code
tracer) in early April of 1996. I began to notice that writing a realtime
code tracer would be quite a task, and therefore left the work up to The
Brain, the author of the Virtual SuperMagicom SNES emulator.

As an SNES programmer, I quickly noticed how SNES disassemblers on the PC
did not follow standard 65c816 syntax, nor follow the standard opcode lay-
out which William D. Mensch, Jr. originally intended. There are no such
opcodes as 'BLT', 'BGE', nor 'JML' -- they are all pseudo-ops, as their
original opcodes are 'BCC', 'BCS', and 'JMP', respectively. Last, but not
least, other disassemblers felt that the length of a BRK/COP instruction
was 1 byte, which is not correct -- it is 2.

My biggest complaint was that neither DISASM v2.0 nor DSFX had what I call
REP/SEP following, which allows the disassembler to change the size of the
accumulator and/or X/Y indexes during disassembly. TRaCER is the only dis-
assembler for the PC, to my knowledge, which incorporates this simple, yet
useful function.
