DSPC - A SPC700 Disassembler
----------------------------

This is a disassembler for the sound processor in the SNES.  The
instruction set was extracted from hbt-fasm, ALL other info from famidev
messages with D Burton.

usage: dspc infile

-?
Commands:

drop bookmark   b
dump            d address
info            i
jmp to bookmark j
load file       l filename
unassemble      u address
quit            back to Dos

Note: All numbers are in hex.


Infile data format
------------------

The following is from a msg. with D Burton:

> Any info on the structure & size of the header block?
>

the header is as follows :-

	dw length_of_block,transfer_address

	db start_of_data
	.....
	db end_of_data

this is repeated for however many blocks u wanna load into the spc(often just
one big block)
then the final header reads:-

	dw $0000,program_execution_address

the zero length field tells it to get ready to run the module..

I have assumed that spc700 data space is 64k.  This may or may not be
correct.  If length_of_block+transfer_address exceedes the address
space, block loading will be terminated.
