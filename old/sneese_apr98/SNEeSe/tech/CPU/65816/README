Ok Boys and Girls heres a 65816 emulator that runs.
YES NINTENDO GAMES
NO GRAPHICS,NO SOUND JUST STEPS THROUGH THE CODE

I started it in hope that I could help develop a simple SNES emulator to write code on and test
on the PC.  But I dont have alot of time.

To all the skeptics.
Yes I beleive you can write an emulator.
No  I dont beleive it would be fast(But theres always a chance)

I Am going to try to add
1. Comments on my Code
2. Optimize it
3. Debug it(Please hlp on this guys)
4. A user interface

PLEASE DONT REAM ME ON THE CODE I KNOW ITS NOT THE HOTEST ITS THE EFFORT OF 4 Hours Work while
watching TV.

I wrote it in Borland 4.0 under QuickWin.
Change the #include "f:\emulator\include\memory.h" to whereever you put the include files(BORLAND HAS A MEMORY.H)
It makes a 4 meg virtual memory file
Also change the hardcoded cart file in the cart.c file to the location of your cart.  It is "f:\cdi.smc".

You may abuse my code as much as you desire but please send me your updates.

PLEASE EMAIL ME WITH IDEAS,CHANGES and BUGS to my 70+hr a week day job

The books I used was Apple IIGS Programming the SNES Programming Manual and the SNES Mailing List.
