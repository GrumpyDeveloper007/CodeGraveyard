Insert your favorite cart, power up the TV, switch the snes power to
ON.. :-)

The sprite images are stored in VRAM.  The palettes for the sprites
are stored in CGRAM.  The coordinates and char attributes are stored
in OAM.

The format of each OBJ is:

OBJ H position: 8 bits
OBJ V position: 8 bits
V flip: 1 bit
H flip: 1 bit
OBJ priority: 2 bits
color palette: 3 bits
character name: 9 bits

there are 128 of these in sequence making 512 bytes then 32 bytes
follow in the format:
size: 1 bit
x msb: 1 bit

there are 128 of these (one for every OBJ) making 32 more bytes.

$2101 is OBJSEL

it chooses the size of sprites to use and also sets the address of the
images in VRAM.  the top 3 bits chose the size:

000 means 8x8 and 16x16 sprites
001 8x8 and 32x32
010 8x8 and 64x64
011 16x16 and 32x32
100 16x16 and 64x64
101 32x32 and 64x64

the other bits are the address in vram of the sprite images.


$2102-$2103 is OAMADDL/H
the lower 9 bits are the address for accessing the OAM. (like $2116
for VRAM)
the high bit (15) enables priority rotation (causes OBJ's to change
priority as to keep them from disappearing totally when time out and range
over occur.)

$2104 is OAMDATA

it is the write register for the OAM. (like $2118-$2119 for VRAM)


$2138 is *OAMDATA

it is the read register for the OAM.


Hope this gives you enough to play with.  Most is from memory, I hope
its all correct. :-)

Lemme know if you have questions.
