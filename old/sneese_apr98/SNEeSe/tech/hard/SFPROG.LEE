-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.  What exactly is the Super Famicom?

A.  The Super Famicom is the Japanese version of the American SNES 
    (Super Nintendo Entertainment System).  As far as hardware goes,
    they are generally the same and play the same games (SF games can 
    be played on the SNES and vice versa).  The Super Famicom however
    has a different appearance than the SNES, but other than cosmetic
    differences, they are virtually the same system.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.  What exactly do people use to develope games on the SNES?
   
A.  _Professional_ developers, to my knowledge, use a PC and a special
    65816 assembler called SNASM which assembles and allows debugging of
    65816 code, also included is a device which (I believe) plugs into
    the SNES and you download code from your PC to the SNES through a 
    SCSI interface.  This developers kit is available through Nintendo,
    but to my knowledge is *extremely* expensive (say around $5000), and
    Nintendo won't sell it to you unless you belong to a gaming company.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.  What about the demos I've seen floating about, how were those made?

A.  There are also console "backup" devices like the Super Magicom (SNES/
    Super Famicom backup), Super MagicDrive (Sega Genesis backup), and
    MultiGame Hunter (Genesis and SNES backup) to name a few.  People 
    download their own code to these devices using 65816 cross assemblers
    (apparently availabe to most major platforms), and the SNES runs it.
    You have to have a pretty good knowledge of the SNES hardware, and of
    course be an expert 65816 assembler.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.  Where can I get some files which explain the technicial details of
    the SNES, like memory locations and such?

A.  An FTP site is available (run by me).  ftp busop.cit.wayne.edu.  
    Development files should be located in \sys\pub\famidev.  Also,
    you should be able to find utilities such as assemblers and 
    disassemblers.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.  What the heck is an 65816 ?

A.  It's a microprocessor made by Western Design which is a basically a 
    souped up 16-bit version of the 6502 (used in older computers like the 
    Commodore 64, etc) and is currently (and probably for enternity) only 
    used in the Apple IIgs system, and of course the SNES/Super Famicom 
    systems.  It has 16-bit internal registers and an 8-bit bus.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.  How do I start working for Nintendo, then ?

A.  Probably the best way to land a job programming for the SNES would be
    to prove yourself an 65816 expert, and send them a demo of a game
    written perferably on a DIFFERENT platform (say like the Apple IIgs 
    might be a good computer to show a demo on), Nintendo may not like the
    fact that you've been coding on their system without any licenses.
    Or, you can try to get a job at a company that produces SNES games
    by showing them your game, and getting them to LEGALLY license it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.  Where do I get a copy of this "Developers Manual" everyone seems to
    be talking about?

A.  You don't.  Nintendo distributes their developers manual only to 
    licensed game programmers and is apparently very strict about it
    being copied or information being let out from it.  Plus, if you 
    paid $5,000 for a developers kit, would you be so quick to send
    out copies of the manual?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.  Can I talk about stupid stuff that has nothing to do with SNES
    development on this mail group?

A.  No.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, that's it so far.  I may not be the best person to write this FAQ,
but so far I'm the only one who has been willing to do it.  If you wish
to make modifications, let me know.  Your free to make additions/modifcations  
to this document.  Just send the revised document to my mail box and I will
replace this one.
