Approved by the Institute of Chartered Accounts of England and Wales
DREAM is designed around the concept of a 'unified ledger'. 
This means that your accounts are completely integrated - you do not have to maintain
 physically separate ledgers and duplicate entries between them. 'Modular' reconciliations
 are completely eliminated. Immediate benefits of the DREAM design are that: 

All data is instantly updated 
Analysis/Reporting is based directly on Core Accounts data 
The system reflects your organisation's exact business rules 
Complete integration offers considerable ‘month end’ time saving 
Cross ‘Modular’ reporting/drill down is completely flexible and very simple
