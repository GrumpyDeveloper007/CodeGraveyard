<P>
Panning in MIDAS Sound System affects the apparent position of the sound in
stereo environments. Sound panned to ``left'' will be played from the left
speaker, ``right'' from the right one and ``middle'' from both. 64 different
panning positions are available between ``left'' and ``middle'' plus
``right'' and ``middle'', to give smooth control on the sound position.
<P>
In addition, surround sound is also considered a separate panning position.
Sounds played with their panning position set to ``surround'' are played from
the surround speakers if the computer is connected to a surround decoder.
Even if surround equipment is not available, the sound appears to come from
around the listener's head, not from inside it as in ``middle'' panning
position.
<P>
Note that not all Sound Devices necessarily support surround sound.
Furthermore, if the computer is playing in stereo mode, but connected to mono
equipment, all sounds played in ``surround'' will disappear!
