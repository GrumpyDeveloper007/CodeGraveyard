Most sound cards supported by MIDAS Sound System are only capable of playing
one digital sound channel at a time, but still MIDAS supports an unlimited
number of channels with them. This is accomplished through software mixing of
the sound -- the sound channels are mixed digitally together before passing
the sound to the sound card.
<P>
Mixing the sound in software is a complicated process, and, although MIDAS
mixing routines are carefully optimized, can still take a considerable amount
of CPU time. The CPU time used is determined by four factors: The number of
channels active, the mixing rate, the output mode and the type of the samples
played. The time used depends almost linearly on the mixing rate and the
number of channels, and stereo output can take up to 50% more CPU time
than mono. The sample type effect is almost the same - stereo samples can
take up to 50% more CPU than mono ones, and 16-bit samples 50% more
than 8-bit.
<P>
The opposite of software mixing is hardware mixing. Hardware mixing sound
cards are capable of playing multiple digital sounds in hardware, and thus
there is no need to mix the sound in software. This often uses much less CPU
power, depending on the sound card, but as a tradeoff some flexibility is
lost. One problem with hardware mixing cards is, that samples have to be
placed in on-card memory. Very often the cards come with as little as 512kb
of memory, and thus can store only a few samples. The second problem is, that
playing streams with hardware mixing cards is usually impossible. This
severely limits the usability of hardware mixing cards with MIDAS.
