<H2><A NAME="SECTION00521000000000000000">4.2.1 Sound Devices</A></H2>
<P>
Sound Devices are at the very heart of MIDAS. They provide the basic
functionality for playing audio, they manage the samples loaded in the
system, and provide a common programming interface for all supported sound
hardware. Normally a user does not use the Sound Devices directly, but rather
uses MIDAS upper level programming interfaces and libraries to play sound.
However, internally MIDAS is very much centered around Sound Devices, and
anyone doing any lower-level MIDAS programming or just examining the system
source code can't avoid working with them.
<P>
A single Sound Device can contain information for one or more sound card. In
that case the cards are usually different models of the same sound card - for
example, the Sound Blaster series Sound Device includes five different sound
card types: Sound Blaster 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, Pro and 16.
<P>
Internally, a Sound Device is represented by one large data structure. The
structure contains a set of variables for configuring the Sound Device, plus
a number of function pointers. These function pointers are then used to
call the Sound Device functions. This ensures that any code working with
MIDAS Sound Devices only has to maintain a pointer to the current Sound
Device structure in use, and can use any supported Sound Device without code
modification.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00522000000000000000">4.2.2 Generic Module Player</A></H2>
<P>
Generic Module Player, or GMPlayer for short, takes care of all module
playing in MIDAS. Modules in different formats are converted to GMPlayer
internal <EM>gmpModule</EM>        structure format when loaded to memory,
so that a single module player can handle all formats. To maintain best
possible compatibility with all trackers, however, GMPlayer implements some
commands and features differently depending on the original module format.
This ensures that playback quality is not compromised.
<P>
GMPlayer is not limited for playing a single module only, in fact it can be
used to play an unlimited number of songs simultaneously. This way sound
effects can be composed as small song fragments, to eliminate the need for
long samples.
<P>
GMPlayer is not dependent on the underlying sound hardware -- it operates as
easily with no sound output at all as it does with an advanced wavetable
sound card. At initialization phase, GMPlayer is passed a pointer to the
Sound Device that should be used for music playback, and afterwards it
directs all sounds to that Sound Device.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SECTION00523000000000000000">4.2.3 MIDAS kernel</A></H2>
<P>
The MIDAS &quot;kernel&quot; consists of smaller modules used by all system components.
This includes memory management functions, error handling routines, file management
functions and common utility functions. These kernel functions ensure that
MIDAS does not depend on the underlying operating system any C runtime
libraries -- all dependencies are encapsulated in single modules.
