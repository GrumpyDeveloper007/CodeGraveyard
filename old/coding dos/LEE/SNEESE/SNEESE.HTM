<P>Ok, this page is to serve as a download point for SNEeSe the SNES emulator
with extra e's. I hope to have a better looking design for this in a few
days, for now this page is here to prove I am serious about this. Oh, and
no there are no downloads of ROMS here and there never will be, dont ask,
dont email just go elsewhere!</P>

<P>DJGPP&nbsp;V2.0 is being used as the main compiler cos it is very nice,
although I am not happy about the AT&amp;T format assembler. At present
the whole project core is pure C++, so it aint gonna be fast just easily
maintainable.</P>

<P>Well Not Yet. Maybe soon, for now here is a list of features that currently
exist, erm all 3 of them ;-) If you know about this stuff you probably
dont need an emulator but it looks impresive to me!</P>

<UL>
<LI>DMA operations 0 &amp; 1. Although at present only channel 0 is implemented.</LI>

<LI>40 of the 256 opcodes of the 65c816 are implemented (Only 1 ROM works
100%).</LI>

<LI>NMI interrupt works although the timing may not be correct ?</LI>

<LI>SNES&nbsp;Screen MODE 1 is supported, 3 is almost there and 0 has not
been looked at. Dont even ask about Mode 7.</LI>

<LI>BKG Scroll Registers 0-3 are implemented (I havent done Mode 0 yet
so BKG4 is not in use).</LI>

<LI>At present I have no APU&nbsp;skippers, I&nbsp;am unsure how to go
about doing this, so the 1 ROM that works is a demo ROM&nbsp;(Yoshi's to
be precise), and I have simply NOPed his JSR&nbsp;music.</LI>

<LI>Joypad 1 Emulation - currently the keys are fixed but that can be changed
easily enough.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><U><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">How Can You Help Me?</FONT></U></B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Well I need information on the timings of the 65c816 ie. How many cycles
per second per MHz mode.</LI>

<LI>Also any help on replying to messages from the SPC would be nice, as
all musical ROMs will stop at SPC hardware calls until I get around this.</LI>
</UL>
