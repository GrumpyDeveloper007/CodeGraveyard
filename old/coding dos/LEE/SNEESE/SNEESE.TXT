SNEeSe = Snes Emulation (For The Hell Of It)
--------------------------------------------

 Developed by Savoury Snax - (Silence all who disbelieve!)

 Greets - Dark Elf,Kone,rRNA,Dark Claw,Poiple Shadow,Flash,
          MaJiC + all at #babylon5 and #star_wars + Anyone else ?

Dedicated to Yoshi - The one without whom emulation would be just a
                    dream, he was missed before he had even gone.

------- For True SNES Emulation Look No Further Than SNES'97 -------

 Why another SNES emulator ?

	Why the hell not! Seriously, this was developed because I was
in need of a second project (on top of my 3D Engine) which would
occupy my mind when the first was at a stand still. I decided on
SNES emulation because I knew nothing about it! This seems backwards
but I did not want to code something that I had touched on before. I
have used the 6502,Z80 and 68000 processors which kills most other
consoles and computers (I actually began a Sinclair 48K emulator
back in my amiga days). Besides most other emulators have now
gotten very close to total emulation... SNES still lacks sound and
stability, the amiga is the only other emulation nightmare (AGA) since
Marcus got GENEM going again!

 What can SNEeSe do in this version of the program ?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

 I begun once before, but documents problems left me in the lurch!

 So after a month or so, I have started a re-write (well bugs and all
are a pain to track sometimes!).

 Implemented features follow :

 o - 73 opcodes (not instructions) implemented fully.

 o - Memory mappings for lo-rom modes done.

 o - DMA operations 0 & 1, channel 0 only!

 o - Hardware scroll registers for all 4 bkgs.

 o - Video Modes 0,1 & 3 are fully implemented (I think).

 o - Some other hardware registers done such as palette etc.

 o - NMI interrupt running although timings may be a little out.

 o - SNES Joypad 1 is supported keys are currently fixed as :
					<Cursor Keys>  - Directional control
					Q,W,A,S,Z,X    - L,R,Y,X,B,A Buttons
					N,M	       - SELECT,START Buttons

 What is left to do in this emulator ?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Erm, Emulate a SNES. Expect This To Become A Real List Once I
Have A 100% CPU Engine. YUP, The CPU is the slowest emulation process as
I prefer to get it working 100% first time round (if possible) than have
to track down problems later on.

 History
=-=-=-=-=

26 June:
	At last after screaming at the Yoshi Documentation set (Screen.TXT) I
got Mode 1 up and running. Turns out the bit about tiles was completely wrong!
	Modes 3 & 0 are now running properly too.
	Fixed NMI bug (interrupt was being issued without checking 0x4200!!)

25 June:
	Finally got to the end of the Demo cartridge (without doing sound part!).

RE-WRITE OF INITIAL EMULATION PROJECT BEGUN TUE 24 JUNE
NO VERSION NUMBERS YET EXIST!!!
