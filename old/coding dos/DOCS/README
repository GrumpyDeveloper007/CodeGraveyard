DJGPP Tutorials v2.55

Hello,

This is an update to my tutorials on DJGPP:

Setup
  djsetup.txt
  djsetup.html
    djv112.txt
    djv112.html
    djv200.txt
    djv200.html
Graphics
  djgfx.txt
  djgfx.html
ASM
  djasm.txt
  djasm.html

The file that links them all together is djgpp.html.

I'm as busy as ever now because of work so there won't be any major 
changes or additions. (Unless someone finds a glaring inaccuracy)

Just remember that the latest version can be found at
http://www.castle.net/~avly/djgpp.html.

Happy coding!
