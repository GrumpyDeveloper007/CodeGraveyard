This is the fifth of six archives containing the MS-DOS Interrupt List,
Release 46.

This archive contains programs to convert the MS-DOS interrupt list into
hypertext databases for a number of popular hypertext help systems
(other than WinHelp, which is in a separate archive).  These programs
have been contributed by others; I have not tested them because I do
not own any of the help systems for which they produce databases.  If
you have problems, please contact the author of the program with which
you experienced difficulties.  Some of these programs predate, and will
thus not take advantage of, recent enhancements to the list's format.

INTERVUE, the public-domain interrupt list viewer from Hackensack, has
been dropped from the interrupt list distribution until the severe
problems encountered in the version distributed with INTER45 are
resolved (unfortunately, the prior version can not be used because the
interrupt list exceeds its limits).  Instead, Interrupt Helper and
Interrupt Summary are offered in this archive.  Interrupt Summary is
still a very preliminary version; direct any comments and bug reports
to the author (any sent to me will be directed straight to the bit
bucket).

In addition, the source code for INTPRINT, INT.COM, and the Epsilon
extension code I use while editing the list are included in this
archive.

Not included here because it is rather large and is distributed
separately by the author, is IL2HDK by Ron Loewy, a conversion program
to put the interrupt list into Help Development Kit format, from which
it can be converted into about a dozen different formats, including
WinHelp, QuickHelp, Borland THELP, OS/2 IPF, POPHELP, and DESQview/X
help. At the time of this writing, the current version was 3.5
(IL2HDK35).

I have removed INT2HLP.BAT, L2WH.ZIP, and WINHELP.ZIP from the
distribution, since the first is a slow (and old) Perl script to
generate a Windows Help file, the second is a slow AWK script to
generate a Windows Help file, and the third is a slow AWK script
processing the output of INT2HLP.BAT.  Since there is another WinHelp
generator (in a separate archive of this distribution) and IL2HDK is
also available, I decided to remove those three in order to reduce the
size of the archive.

Similarly, I have removed NGCONVER.ZIP because it duplicates RB2NG
but appears to have less functionality.
