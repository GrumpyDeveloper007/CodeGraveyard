--------D-26---------------------------------
INT 26 - DOS 1+ - ABSOLUTE DISK WRITE (except partitions > 32M)
	AL = drive number (00h = A:, 01h = B:, etc)
	CX = number of sectors to write (not FFFFh)
	DX = starting logical sector number (0000h - highest sector on drive)
	DS:BX -> data to write
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	    AH = status (see #1338)
	    AL = error code (same as passed to INT 24 in DI)
	    AX = 0207h if more than 64K sectors on drive -- use new-style call
	may destroy all other registers except segment registers
Notes:	original flags are left on stack, and must be popped by caller
	this call bypasses the DOS filesystem, though DOS 5+ invalidates any
	  disk buffers referencing sectors which are written with this call
	examination of CPWIN386.CPL indicates that if this call fails with
	  error 0408h on an old-style (<32M) call, one should retry the
	  call with the high bit of the drive number in AL set
	Novell DOS 7 decides whether the old-style or new-style (>32M) version
	  of INT 26 must be used solely on the basis of the partition's size,
	  thus forcing use of the new-style call even for data in the first
	  32M of the partition
BUGS:	DOS 3.1 through 3.3 set the word at ES:[BP+1Eh] to FFFFh if AL is an
	  invalid drive number
	DR-DOS 3.41 will return with a jump instead of RETF, leaving the
	  wrong number of bytes on the stack; use the huge-partition version
	  (INT 26/CX=FFFFh) for all partition sizes under DR-DOS 3.41
SeeAlso: INT 13/AH=03h,INT 25,INT 26/CX=FFFFh
--------D-26----CXFFFF-----------------------
INT 26 - DOS 3.31+ - ABSOLUTE DISK WRITE (>32M hard-disk partition)
	CX = FFFFh
	AL = drive number (0=A, 1=B, etc)
	DS:BX -> disk write packet (see #1343)
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	    AH = status (see #1338)
	    AL = error code (same as passed to INT 24 in DI)
	    AX = 0207h if more than 64K sectors on drive -- use new-style call
	may destroy all other registers except segment registers
Notes:	partition is potentially >32M (and requires this form of the call) if
	  bit 1 of the device attribute word in the device driver is set
	original flags are left on stack, and must be removed by caller
	this call bypasses the DOS filesystem, though DOS 5+ invalidates any
	  disk buffers referencing sectors which are written with this call
SeeAlso: INT 13/AH=03h,INT 25/CX=FFFFh,INT 26

Format of disk write packet:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 1343)
 00h	DWORD	sector number
 04h	WORD	number of sectors to read
 06h	DWORD	transfer address
--------G-26---------------------------------
INT 26 - COMTROL HOSTESS i/ISA DEBUGGER - ENTER/EXIT EXTENDED ADDRESSING MODE
	???
Return: ???
SeeAlso: INT 23"COMTROL",INT 27"COMTROL"
--------D-27---------------------------------
INT 27 - DOS 1+ - TERMINATE AND STAY RESIDENT
	DX = number of bytes to keep resident (max FFF0h)
	CS = segment of PSP
Return: never
Notes:	this is an obsolete call
	INT 22, INT 23, and INT 24 are restored from the PSP
	does not close any open files
	the minimum number of bytes which will remain resident is 110h for
	  DOS 2.x and 60h for DOS 3.0+; there is no minimum for DOS 1.x, which
	  implements this service in COMMAND.COM rather than the DOS kernel
SeeAlso: INT 21/AH=31h
--------G-27---------------------------------
INT 27 - COMTROL HOSTESS i/ISA DEBUGGER - INVOKE REMOTE TURBO DEBUGGER KERNEL
	???
Return: ???
Desc:	invoke a copy of the remote Turbo Debugger kernel on the Hostess i
	  controller
SeeAlso: INT 20"COMTROL",INT 26"COMTROL"
--------D-28---------------------------------
INT 28 C - DOS 2+ - DOS IDLE INTERRUPT
	SS:SP = top of MS-DOS stack for I/O functions
Return: all registers preserved
Desc:	This interrupt is invoked each time one of the DOS character input
	  functions loops while waiting for input.  Since a DOS call is in
	  progress even though DOS is actually idle during such input waits,
	  hooking this function is necessary to allow a TSR to perform DOS
	  calls while the foreground program is waiting for user input.	 The
	  INT 28h handler may invoke any INT 21h function except functions
	  00h through 0Ch.
Notes:	under DOS 2.x, the critical error flag (the byte immediately after the
	  InDOS flag) must be set in order to call DOS functions 50h/51h from
	  the INT 28h handler without destroying the DOS stacks.
	calls to INT 21/AH=3Fh,40h from within an INT 28 handler may not use a
	  handle which refers to CON
	at the time of the call, the InDOS flag (see INT 21/AH=34h) is normally
	  set to 01h; if larger, DOS is truly busy and should not be reentered
	the default handler is an IRET instruction
	supported in OS/2 compatibility box
	the _MS-DOS_Programmer's_Reference_ for DOS 5.0 incorrectly documents
	  this interrupt as superseded
SeeAlso: INT 21/AH=34h,INT 2A/AH=84h,INT 2F/AX=1680h
--------D-29---------------------------------
INT 29 C - DOS 2+ - FAST CONSOLE OUTPUT
	AL = character to display
Return: nothing
Notes:	automatically called when writing to a device with bit 4 of its device
	  driver header set (see also INT 21/AH=52h)
	COMMAND.COM v3.2 and v3.3 compare the INT 29 vector against the INT 20
	  vector and assume that ANSI.SYS is installed if the segment is larger
	the default handler under DOS 2.x and 3.x simply calls INT 10/AH=0Eh
	the default handler under DESQview 2.2 understands the <Esc>[2J
	  screen-clearing sequence, calls INT 10/AH=0Eh for all others
SeeAlso: INT 21/AH=52h,INT 2F/AX=0802h,INT 79
--------N-2A00-------------------------------
INT 2A - NETWORK - INSTALLATION CHECK

INT 2A - NETWORK - CHECK DIRECT I/O
	AX = 0300h
	DS:SI -> ASCIZ device name (may be full path or only drive specifier--
		  must include the colon)
Return: CF clear if direct physical addressing (INT 13,INT 25) permissible
	CF set if access via files only
Notes:	do not use direct disk accesses if this function returns CF set or the
	  device is redirected (INT 21/AX=5F02h)
	use AH=00h to determine whether the network is installed; if not,
	  direct physical access is allowed
	may take some time to execute, so programs which need to check
	  frequently should save the result of the first call
	this function is called by the DOS kernel on INT 25 and INT 26
	supported by PC LAN Program, LAN Manage, LANtastic, NetWare, 10NET,
	  etc.

	    AL = error code
Notes:	invokes either INT 5B or INT 5C as appropriate
	supported by PC LAN Program, LANtastic, LAN Manager, NetWare, 10NET,
	  etc.
	NetWare 2.15 NetBIOS emulator returns CF clear if successful, CF set
	  on error
	PC LAN Program defines any non-zero return value in AH as an error
	  indicator for subfunction 00h, and any non-zero return value in AX
	  as an error indicator for subfunction 01h

	the application should call this function before using any network
	  resources, and maintain its own count to avoid exceeding the
	  network's resource limits

	AL <> 00h if user logged on to Extended Services
	    buffer at ES:DI filled with name, padded to 8 chars with blanks.
--------D-2A80-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - BEGIN DOS CRITICAL SECTION
	AH = 80h
	AL = critical section number (00h-0Fh) (see #1344)
Notes:	normally hooked to avoid interrupting a critical section, rather than
	  called
	the handler should ensure that none of the critical sections are
	  reentered, usually by suspending a task which attempts to reenter
	  an active critical section
	the DOS kernel does not invoke critical sections 01h and 02h unless it
	  is patched.  DOS 3.1+ contains a zero-terminated list of words
	  beginning at offset -11 from the Swappable Data Area
	  (see #0892 at INT 21/AX=5D06h); each word contains the offset within
	  the DOS data segment of a byte which must be changed from C3h (RET)
	  to 50h (POP AX) under DOS 3.x or from 00h to a nonzero value under
	  DOS 4.0+ to enable use of critical sections.	For DOS 4.0+, all
	  words in this list point at the byte at offset 0D0Ch.
	MS Windows patches the DOS kernel's calls to INT 2A/AH=80h-81h into
	  far calls to its own handler, and does not reflect the calls back
	  to INT 2A unless SYSTEM.INI contains ReflectDOSInt2A=1 or
	  ModifyDOSInt2A=0 in the [386Enh] section
	Novell NETX does not issue INT 2A/AH=80h and INT 2A/AH=81h calls when
	  it intercepts INT 21 calls and processes them itself
SeeAlso: AH=81h,AH=82h,AX=8700h,INT 21/AX=5D06h,INT 21/AX=5D0Bh

(Table 1344)
Values for DOS critical section number:
 01h	DOS kernel, SHARE.EXE, DOSMGR
	apparently for maintaining the integrity of DOS/SHARE/NET
	  data structures
 02h	DOS kernel, DOSMGR
	ensures that no multitasking occurs while DOS is calling an
	  installable device driver
 05h	network redirector
 06h	DOS 4.x only IFSFUNC
 08h	ASSIGN.COM
 0Ah	MSCDEX
 0Fh	IBM PC LAN server (while intercepting INT 10/AH=06h,07h,0Eh)
--------D-2A81-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - END DOS CRITICAL SECTION
	AH = 81h
	AL = critical section number (00h-0Fh) (see #1344)
Notes:	normally hooked rather than called
	the handler should reawaken any tasks which were suspended due to an
	  attempt to enter the specified critical section
	MS Windows patches the DOS kernel's calls to INT 2A/AH=80h-81h into
	  far calls to its own handler, and does not reflect the calls back
	  to INT 2A unless SYSTEM.INI contains ReflectDOSInt2A=1 or
	  ModifyDOSInt2A=0 in the [386Enh] section
SeeAlso: AH=80h,AH=82h,AX=8700h
--------D-2A82-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - END DOS CRITICAL SECTIONS 0 THROUGH 7
	AH = 82h
Notes:	called by the INT 21h function dispatcher for function 0 and functions
	  greater than 0Ch except 59h, and on process termination
	the handler should reawaken any tasks which were suspended due to an
	  attempt to enter one of the critical sections 0 through 7
SeeAlso: AH=81h
--------N-2A84-------------------------------
INT 2A CU - NETWORK - KEYBOARD BUSY LOOP
	AH = 84h
Note:	similar to DOS's INT 28h, called from inside the DOS keyboard input
	  loop (i.e. INT 21/AH=07h or INT 21/AH=08h) to allow the network
	  software to process requests

--------P-2A8700-----------------------------
INT 2A CU - PRINT - BEGIN BACKGROUND PRINTING
	AX = 8700h
	CF clear
Return: CF clear if OK to print in background now
	CF set if background printing not allowed at this time
Desc:	used to inform interested programs that PRINT is about to start its
	  background processing, and allow those programs to postpone the
	  processing if necessary
Notes:	when PRINT gains control and wants to begin printing, it calls this
	  function.  If CF is clear on return, PRINT begins its background
	  processing, and calls AX=8701h when it is done.  If CF is set on
	  return, PRINT will relinquish control immediately, and will not
	  call AX=8701h
	PCVENUS (an early network shell by IBM and CMU) hooks this call to
	  prevent background printing while its own code is active
SeeAlso: AH=80h,AH=81h,AX=8701h
--------P-2A8701-----------------------------
INT 2A CU - PRINT - END BACKGROUND PRINTING
	AX = 8701h
Desc:	used to inform interested programs that PRINT has completed its
	  background processing
Note:	called by PRINT after it has performed some background printing; not
	  called if AX=8700h returned with CF set.

INT 2C - STARLITE architecture - KERNEL API
Note:	STARLITE is an architecture by General Software for a series of MS-DOS
	  compatible operating systems (OEM DOS, NETWORK DOS, and SMP DOS) to
	  be released in 1991.	The interrupt number is subject to change
	  before the actual release.
--------m-2C---------------------------------
INT 2C R - Cloaking - CALL PROTECTED-MODE PASSALONG CHAIN
Notes:	when this interrupt is invoked in V86 mode, RM386 will invoke the first
	  in a chain of protected-mode handlers, and will only pass execution
	  to the V86-mode INT 2C handler if none of the handlers in the
	  passalong chain handle the call instead.  This is the method by which
	  the real-mode stub of a cloaked application communicates with the
	  protected-mode portion.
	the cloaking host calls the passalong chain with EAX=58494E33h ('WIN3')
	  when MS Windows starts up and with EAX=334E4958h ('3NIW') when
	  Windows shuts down; between these two broadcasts, the additional
	  Windows-only Cloaking services are available
	this function was first introduced with RM386 (RAM-MAN/386) v6.00, the
	  memory manager included in Helix Software's Netroom

Notes:	programs should not use fixed multiplex numbers; rather, a program
	  should scan all multiplex numbers from 00h to FFh, remembering the
	  first unused multiplex in case the program is not yet installed.
	  For multiplex numbers which are in use, the program should compare
	  the first 16 bytes of the signature string to determine whether it
	  is already installed on that multiplex number.  If not previously
	  installed, it should use the first free multiplex number.
	functions other than 00h are not valid unless a program is installed
	  on the selected multiplex number
	to be considered fully compliant with version 3.5 of the specification,
	  programs must implement at least functions 00h, 02h (no resident
	  uninstall code required), and 04h (return value 04h).	 TSRs that
	  provide hotkeys with which the user can activate them must also
	  implement function 05h.  The absolute minimum fully-compliant
	  implementation has an overhead of 64 bytes (80 bytes with function
	  05h) plus 22 bytes per hooked interrupt (for the interrupt sharing
	  protocol header and hook list entry).
	the signature string and description may be used by memory mappers
	  to display the installed programs
	users of this proposal should adhere to the IBM interrupt sharing
	  protocol (see #1363), which will permit removal of TSRs in
	  arbitrary order and interrupt handler reordering.  All TSRs
	  following this proposal should be removable, though they need not
	  keep the code for removing themselves resident; it is acceptable
	  for a separate program to perform the removal.
	A sample implementation including example TSRs and utility programs
	  may be found in a separate package distributed as AMISLnnn.ZIP
	  (AMISL091.ZIP as of this writing).
	Please let me know if you choose to follow this proposal.  The
	  signature and a list of the private API calls you use would be
	  appreciated, as well.

Format of AMIS signature string:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 1357)
 00h  8 BYTEs	blank-padded manufacturer's name (possibly abbreviated)
 08h  8 BYTEs	blank-padded product name

Note:	it is not necessary to reserve a full 64 bytes for the description,
	  just enough to store the actual ASCIZ string
SeeAlso: #1364

Format of AMIS interrupt hook list [array]:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 1358)
 00h	BYTE	interrupt number (last entry in array is 2Dh)
 01h	WORD	offset within hook list's segment of the interrupt handler
		this will point at the initial short jump of the interrupt
		  sharing protocol header (see #1363)

Format of AMIS hotkey list:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 1359)
 00h	BYTE	type of hotkey checking (see #1360)
 01h	BYTE	number of hotkeys (may be zero if TSR can disable hotkeys)
 02h 6N BYTEs	array of hotkey definitions

		 05h	BYTE	hotkey flags (see #1362)
Notes:	except for bit 7, the shift states correspond exactly to the return
	  values from INT 16/AH=12h.  A set bit in the required states word
	  indicates that the corresponding shift state must be active when the
	  hotkey's scan code is received for the hotkey to be recognized; a
	  clear bit means that the corresponding state may be ignored.	A set
	  bit in the disallowed shift states word indicates that the
	  corresponding shift state must be inactive.
	for the disallowed-states word, if one of the "either" bits is set,
	  then both the corresponding left bit and right bit must be set

	since COMMAND.COM processes the string as if typed from the keyboard,
	  the transient portion needs to be present, and the calling program
	  must ensure that sufficient memory to load the transient portion can
	  be allocated by DOS if necessary
	results are unpredictable if invoked by a program run from a batch file

	AL is the function code
   This is a general mechanism for verifying the presence of a TSR and
   communicating with it.  When searching for a free identifier code for AH
   using the installation check (AL=00h), the calling program should set
   BX/CX/DX to 0000h and must not depend on any registers other than CS:IP
   and SS:SP to be valid on return, since numerous programs now use additional
   registers on input and/or output for the installation check.
Notes:	Since the multiplex chain is growing so long, and beginning to
	  experience multiplex number collisions, I am proposing an alternate
	  multiplex interrupt on INT 2D.  If you decide to use the alternate
	  multiplex, please let me know.
	DOS and some other programs return values in the flags register, so
	  any TSR which chains by calling the previous handler rather than

 04h 2N WORDs	table of all error headers for table
		Offset	Size	Description
		 00h	WORD	error message number
		 02h	WORD	offset of error message from start of header
				error messages are count byte followed by msg
Note:	DOS 5 error tables consist of one word per error number; each word
	  contains either the offset of a counted string or 0000h

(Table 1400)
Call error retrieval function with:
	AX = error number (see #1401)
	DI = offset of error table
Return: ES:DI -> error message (counted string)
Notes:	this function needs to access COMMAND.COM if the messages were not
	  loaded into memory permanently with /MSG; the caller should assume
	  that the returned message will be overwritten by the next call of
	  the function
	supported by DR-DOS 5.0

Notes:	IO.SYS hooks INT 13 and inserts one or more filters ahead of the

	  on floppy drives, the second is for tracking formatting calls and
	  correcting DMA boundary errors, the third is for working around
	  problems in a particular version of IBM's ROM BIOS
	before the first call, ES:BX points at the original BIOS INT 13; DS:DX
	  also points there unless IO.SYS has installed a special filter for
	  hard disk reads (on systems with model byte FCh and BIOS date
	  "01/10/84" only), in which case it points at the special filter
	most DOS 3.2+ disk access is via the vector in DS:DX, although a few

Notes:	the Windows enhanced mode loader and Microsoft 286 DOS extender will

	  driver or TSR can watch for this broadcast and return the appropriate
	  values.  If the driver or TSR returns CX <> 0, it is also its
	  responsibility to display an error message.
	each handler must first chain to the prior INT 2F handler with
	  registers unchanged before processing the call
	if the handler requires local data on a per-VM basis, it must store the
	  returned ES:BX in the "next" field of a startup info structure and
	  return a pointer to that structure in ES:BX
	a single TSR may set the V86 mode enable/disable callback; if DS:SI is
	  already nonzero, the TSR must fail the initialization by setting CX
	  nonzero
	MSD checks for Windows 3.0 running in standard mode by testing whether
	  CX=FFFFh and other registers are unchanged on return
	Novell DOS v7.0 (Update 8 - Update 11) TASKMGR in multitasking mode
	  uses this broadcast, even if TASKMGR.INI sets WinPresent= to OFF

	    00h if the call is supported
	    80h (unchanged) if the call is not supported
Notes:	programs can use this function in idle loops to enhance performance
	  under multitaskers; this call is supported by MS Windows 3.0, DOS 5+,
	  DPMI 1.0+, and in OS/2 2.0+ for multitasking DOS applications
	does not block the program; it just gives up the remainder of the time
	  slice
	should not be used by Windows-specific programs
	when called very often without intermediate screen output under WIN 3+,
	  the VM will go into an idle-state and will not receive the next slice
	  before 8 seconds. This time can be changed in SYSTEM.INI through
	  "IdleVMWakeUpTime=<seconds>". Setting to zero results in a long wait.

Return: ES:DI -> VxD API entry point, or 0:0 if the VxD does not support an API
Note:	some Windows enhanced-mode virtual devices provide services that
	  applications can access.  For example, the Virtual Display Device
	  (VDD) provides an API used in turn by WINOLDAP.

		either short jump (EBh XXh) followed by three NOPs or
		  far jump (EAh XXXX:XXXX) to a program which has hooked itself
		  into the XMS driver chain
Note:	to hook into the XMS driver chain, a program should follow the chain of
	  far jumps until it reaches the short jump of the driver at the end
	  of the chain; this short jump is to be replaced with a far jump to
	  the new handler's entry point, which should contain a short jump
	  followed by three NOPs.  The new handler must return to the address
	  pointed at by the short jump which was overwritten.  Using this
	  method, the new handler becomes the first to see every XMS request.

Return: AX = 0000h if successful
Notes:	the first byte (length) of the buffer MUST be 80h, or DOSKEY chains to
	  the previous handler; PCED allows sizes other than 80h
	if the user's input is a macro name, no text is placed in the buffer
	  even though AX=0000h on return; the program must immediately issue
	  this call again to retrieve the expansion of the macro.  Similarly,
	  if the user enters a special parameter such as $*, this call must
	  be repeated to retrieve the expansion; on the second call, DOSKEY
	  overwrites the macro name on the screen with its expansion.
	unlike DOSKEY, PCED expands all macros on the first call, so it is
	  not necessary to make two calls; since the buffer is not empty on
	  return, DOSKEY-aware programs will not make the second call
	DOSKEY chains if AL is not 00h or 10h on entry

		  is used to work with STACVOL files created under older
		  versions of Stacker.
