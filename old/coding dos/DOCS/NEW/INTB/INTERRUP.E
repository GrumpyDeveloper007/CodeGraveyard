Note:	the variant of the call requesting five bytes is an UNDOCUMENTED
	  extension supported by Adaptec's ASPI2DOS.SYS, ASPI4DOS.SYS, and
	  ASPI7DOS.SYS; if made of a host manager which does not support the
	  variant, only four bytes will be returned.  If the variant is
	  supported, Adaptec's WINASPI.DLL assumes that the host manager is
	  an "advanced" one which operates in either real or protected mode
	  (and thus does not require a DPMI INT 31/AX=0301h call to be invoked
	  from protected mode).	 Support of the five-byte variant also appears
	  to imply that an advanced ASPI host manager uses no temporary
	  storage space except the SRB (see #0676) and the stack, and that it
	  is fully reentrant.
	if called with a standard request for four bytes, even Adaptec's
	  advanced drivers return only the requested four bytes containing the
	  ASPI entry point address
	the function address is called with the address of a SCSI Request
	  Block (see #0676) on the stack and the caller must clean up the
	  stack

Notes:	if the value given in CX is less than the size of the state record

	the state is 40h bytes for 386MAX (actually ASTEMM) v2.20 ("386MAX$$"
	  did not exist yet, use "QMMXXXX0" and then "EMMXXXX0" instead) and
	  56h bytes for v5.11.
	to invoke 386MAX API functions, push DX onto the stack, load DX with
	  the word at offset 25h in the returned state, load all other
	  registers as needed for the desired function, and execute an
	  OUT DX,AL or OUT DX,AX; DX will be set to the pushed value on return
	  if it is not otherwise modified by the API function.	For safety,
	  in case a function is not supported or 386MAX is not present, SP
	  should be saved and restored around the API call.
	Windows 3.1 Standard mode, LAN Manager, and Windows for Workgroups all

Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = new handle
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (04h,06h) (see #0885 at AH=59h)
Notes:	moving file pointer for either handle will also move it for the other,
	  because both will refer to the same system file table
	for DOS versions prior to 3.3, file writes may be forced to disk by
	  duplicating the file handle and closing the duplicate

	    AX = error code (04h,06h) (see #0885 at AH=59h)
Notes:	closes file with handle CX if it is still open
	DOS 3.30 hangs if BX=CX on entry

Return: CF clear if successful
	    AX = segment of allocated block
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (07h,08h) (see #0885 at AH=59h)
	    BX = size of largest available block
Notes:	DOS 2.1-6.0 coalesces free blocks while scanning for a block to
	  allocate
	.COM programs are initially allocated the largest available memory
	  block, and should free some memory with AH=49h before attempting any
	  allocations
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, EBX contains a protected-mode
	  near pointer to the allocated block on a successful return
SeeAlso: AH=49h,AH=4Ah,AH=58h,AH=83h
--------D-2149-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - FREE MEMORY

	ES = segment of block to free
Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (07h,09h) (see #0885 at AH=59h)
Notes:	apparently never returns an error 07h, despite official docs; DOS 2.1+
	  code contains only an error 09h exit
	DOS 2.1-6.0 does not coalesce adjacent free blocks when a block is
	  freed, only when a block is allocated or resized
	the code for this function is identical in DOS 2.1-6.0 except for
	  calls to start/end a critical section in DOS 3.0+
SeeAlso: AH=48h,AH=4Ah
--------D-214A-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 2+ - RESIZE MEMORY BLOCK
	AH = 4Ah

Return: CF clear if successful
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (07h,08h,09h) (see #0885 at AH=59h)
	    BX = maximum paragraphs available for specified memory block
Notes:	under DOS 2.1-6.0, if there is insufficient memory to expand the block
	  as much as requested, the block will be made as large as possible
	DOS 2.1-6.0 coalesces any free blocks immediately following the block
	  to be resized

		INT 21/AH=62h
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (01h,02h,05h,08h,0Ah,0Bh) (see #0885 at AH=59h)
Notes:	DOS 2.x destroys all registers, including SS:SP
	under ROM-based DOS, if no disk path characters (colons or slashes)
	  are included in the program name, the name is searched for in the
	  ROM module headers (see #0808) before searching on disk
	for functions 00h and 01h, the calling process must ensure that there
	  is enough unallocated memory available; if necessary, by releasing
	  memory with AH=49h or AH=4Ah
	for function 01h, the AX value to be passed to the child program is put
	  on top of the child's stack
	for function 03h, DOS assumes that the overlay is being loaded into
	  memory allocated by the caller
	function 01h was undocumented prior to the release of DOS 5.0
	some versions (such as DR-DOS 6.0) check the parameters and parameter
	  block and return an error if an invalid value (such as an offset of
	  FFFFh) is found
	background programs under European MS-DOS 4.0 must use the new
	  executable format
	this function ignores the filename extension, instead checking the
	  first two bytes of the file to determine whether there is a valid
	  .EXE header (see #0807); if not, the file is assumed to be in .COM
	  format.  If present, the file may be in any of several formats which
	  are extensions of the original .EXE format (see #0806)
	.COM-format executables begin running with the following register
	  values:
		AL = 00h if first FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		AH = 00h if second FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		CS,DS,ES,SS = PSP segment
		SP = offset of last word available in first 64K segment
		(note: AX is always 0000h under DESQview)
	old-format executables begin running with the following register
	  values:
		AL = 00h if first FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		AH = 00h if second FCB has valid drive letter, FFh if not
		DS,ES = PSP segment
		SS:SP as defined in .EXE header
		(note: AX is always 0000h under DESQview)
	new executables begin running with the following register values
		AX = environment segment
		BX = offset of command tail in environment segment
		CX = size of automatic data segment (0000h = 64K)
		ES,BP = 0000h
		DS = automatic data segment
		SS:SP = initial stack
	  the command tail corresponds to an old executable's PSP:0081h and
	  following, except that the 0Dh is turned into a NUL (00h); new
	  format executables have no PSP
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, only function 00h is supported
	  and the pointers are passed in DS:EDX and ES:EBX
	DR-DOS 6 always loads .EXE-format programs with no fixups and
	  .COM-format programs starting with 9Ch 55h (PUSHF/PUSH BP) above the
	  64K mark to avoid the EXEPACK bug, by extending the memory block
	  containing the program's environment; this code is disabled if the
	  name of the parent program as stored in the MCB is 'WIN'.
BUGS:	DOS 2.00 assumes that DS points at the current program's PSP
	Load Overlay (subfunction 03h) loads up to 512 bytes too many if the
	  file contains additional data after the actual overlay

Notes:	for search attributes other than 08h, all files with at MOST the
	  specified combination of hidden, system, and directory attributes
	  will be returned.  Under DOS 2.x, searching for attribute 08h
	  (volume label) will also return normal files, while under DOS 3.0+
	  only the volume label (if any) will be returned.
	this call also returns successfully if given the name of a character
	  device without wildcards.  DOS 2.x returns attribute 00h, size 0,
	  and the current date and time.  DOS 3.0+ returns attribute 40h and
	  the current date and time.
	immediately after an INT 2F/AX=B711h (APPEND return found name), the
	  name at DS:DX will be overwritten; if AL=00h on entry, the actual
	  found pathname will be stored, otherwise, the actual found path
	  will be prepended to the original filespec without a path.
	under LANtastic, this call may be used to obtain a list of a server's
	  shared resources by searching for "\\SERVER\*.*"; a list of printer
	  resources may be obtained by searching for "\\SERVER\@*.*"
	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the filespec pointer is in DS:EDX
BUGS:	under DOS 3.x and 4.x, the second and subsequent calls to this function
	  with a character device name (no wildcards) and search attributes
	  which include the volume-label bit (08h) will fail unless there is
	  an intervening DOS call which implicitly or explicity performs a
	  directory search without the volume-label bit.  Such implicit
	  searches are performed by CREATE (AH=3Ch), OPEN (AH=3Dh), UNLINK
	  (AH=41h), and RENAME (AH=56h)

	some Microsoft applications such as Quick C 2.51 use segments of 0000h
	  and FFFFh and direct access to the SDA (see #0892 at AX=5D06h) to
	  test whether they are running under MS-DOS rather than a compatible
	  OS; although one should only call this function with valid PSP

INT 21 U - DOS 3.0+ internal - GET ADDRESS OF DOS SWAPPABLE DATA AREA
	AX = 5D06h
Return: CF set on error
	   AX = error code (see #0885)
	CF clear if successful
	    DS:SI -> nonreentrant data area (includes all three DOS stacks)
		(critical error flag is first byte) (see #0892)
	    CX = size in bytes of area which must be swapped while in DOS
	    DX = size in bytes of area which must always be swapped
Notes:	the Critical Error flag is used in conjunction with the InDOS flag
	  (see AH=34h) to determine when it is safe to enter DOS from a TSR
	setting CritErr flag allows use of functions 50h/51h from INT 28h under
	  DOS 2.x by forcing use of correct stack
	swapping the data area allows reentering DOS unless DOS is in a
	  critical section delimited by INT 2A/AH=80h and INT 2A/AH=81h,82h
	under DOS 4.0, AX=5D0Bh should be used instead of this function
	SHARE and other DOS utilities consult the byte at offset 04h in the
	  DOS data segment (see INT 2F/AX=1203h) to determine the SDA format
	  in use: 00h = DOS 3.x, 01h = DOS 4.0-6.0, other = error.
	DR-DOS 3.41+ supports this function, but the SDA format beyond the
	  first 18h bytes is completely different from MS-DOS

INT 21 - DOS 3.1+ - SET EXTENDED ERROR INFORMATION

	DS:DX -> 11-word DOS parameter list (see #0891)
Return: nothing.  next call to AH=59h will return values from fields AX,BX,CX,
	  DX,DI, and ES in corresponding registers
Notes:	documented for DOS 5+, but undocumented in earlier versions
	the MS-DOS Programmer's Reference incorrectly states that this call was
	  introduced in DOS 4, and fails to mention that the ERROR structure
	  passed to this function is a DOS parameter list.
BUGS:	DR-DOS 3.41 and 5.0 read the value for ES from the DS field of the
	  DPL; fortunately, MS-DOS ignores the DS field, allowing a generic
	  routine which sets both DS and ES fields to the same value

INT 21 - DOS 3.0+ - "TRUENAME" - CANONICALIZE FILENAME OR PATH
	AH = 60h
	DS:SI -> ASCIZ filename or path
	ES:DI -> 128-byte buffer for canonicalized name
Return: CF set on error
	    AX = error code
		02h invalid component in directory path or drive letter only
		03h malformed path or invalid drive letter
	    ES:DI buffer unchanged
	CF clear if successful
	    AH = 00h
	    AL = destroyed (00h or 5Ch or last char of current dir on drive)
	    buffer filled with qualified name of form D:\PATH\FILE.EXT or
	      \\MACHINE\PATH\FILE.EXT
Desc:	determine the canonical name of the specified filename or path,
	  corresponding to the undocumented TRUENAME command in COMMAND.COM
Notes:	the input path need not actually exist
	letters are uppercased, forward slashes converted to backslashes,
	  asterisks converted to appropriate number of question marks, and
	  file and directory names are truncated to 8.3 if necessary.  (DR-DOS
	  3.41 and 5.0 do not expand asterisks)
	'.' and '..' in the path are resolved
	filespecs on local drives always start with "d:", those on network
	  drives always start with "\\"
	if path string is on a JOINed drive, the returned name is the one that
	  would be needed if the drive were not JOINed; similarly for a
	  SUBSTed, ASSIGNed, or network drive letter.	Because of this, it is
	  possible to get a qualified name that is not legal under the current
	  combination of SUBSTs, ASSIGNs, JOINs, and network redirections
	under DOS 3.3 through 6.00, a device name is translated differently if
	  the device name does not have an explicit directory or the directory
	  is \DEV (relative directory DEV from the root directory works
	  correctly).  In these cases, the returned string consists of the
	  unchanged device name and extension appended to the string X:/
	  (forward slash instead of backward slash as in all other cases) where
	  X is the default or explicit drive letter.
	functions which take pathnames require canonical paths if invoked via
	  INT 21/AX=5D00h
	supported by OS/2 v1.1 compatibility box
	NetWare 2.1x does not support characters with the high bit set; early
	  versions of NetWare 386 support such characters except in this call.
	  In addition, NetWare returns error code 3 for the path "X:\"; one
	  should use "X:\." instead.
	for DOS 3.3-6.0, the input and output buffers may be the same, as the
	  canonicalized name is built in an internal buffer and copied to the
	  specified output buffer as the very last step
	for DR DOS 6.0, this function is not automatically called when on a
	  network.  Device drivers reportedly cannot make this call from their
	  INIT function.  Using the same pointer for both input and output
	  buffers is not supported in the April 1992 and earlier versions of
	  DR DOS
	Corel's CORELCDX and MSCDEX without the /S switch return canonical
	  names of the form "\\D.\A.\path", where "D" is the CD-ROM drive
	  letter and "A" appears to indicate the first physical CD-ROM drive;
	  MSCDEX with the /S switch returns a canonical name with embedded
	  blanks.  Novell DOS 7 NWCDEX as of the 11/16/94 update returns the
	  same canonical path as MSCDEX; earlier revisions returned
	  "Cdex.D:\path", where "D" is the CD-ROM drive letter

--------D-2162-------------------------------
INT 21 - DOS 3.0+ - GET CURRENT PSP ADDRESS
	AH = 62h
Return: BX = segment of PSP for current process
Notes:	this function does not use any of the DOS-internal stacks and may
	  thus be called at any time, even during another INT 21h call
	the current PSP is not necessarily the caller's PSP
	identical to the undocumented AH=51h
