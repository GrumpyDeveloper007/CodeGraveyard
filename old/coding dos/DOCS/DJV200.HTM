All files should be unpacked by typing "<b>pkunzip -d file.zip</b>" or "<b>unzip file.zip.</b>"
<p>
V2.01 is available at <a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/"> simtelnet</a>, among others. The files are distributed in the following directories: <a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2/">v2/</a>, <a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/">v2gnu/</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2misc/">v2misc/</a>. For C development, you need: (with their zip file sizes)
<ul>
<li> djdev201.zip - Development Kit and Runtime (1530K)
<li> gcc2721b.zip  - GCC 2.7.2.1 (1090K)
<li> bnu27b.zip  - GNU binutils 2.7 (1710K)
<li> txi390b.zip - GNU texinfo 3.90 (438K)
<li> csdpmi(1|2|3)b.zip - CWS's DPMI server (30-50K)
</ul>
Additionally, for C++, these are also needed:
<ul>
<li> gpp2721b.zip - G++ 2.7.2.1 (680K) 
<li> lgp271b.zip - libg++ 2.7.1 (638K)
</ul>
The following tools are highly recommended for C or C++ programming:
<ul>
<li> gdb416b.zip - GNU Debugger 4.16 (520K)
<li> mak375b.zip - GNU Make 3.75 (209K)
</ul>
Other things one might find useful:
<ul>
<li> djlsr201.zip - base library sources (1460K) 
<li> lgp271s.zip - libg++ 2.7.1 sources (970K)
</ul>
<p>
In general, for v2, *b.zip are binaries (and docs), and *sr*.zip and *s.zip are the sources.

After unpacking the files into a directory, you need to set up a few environment variables and make sure the compiler knows where to look for important things such as standard include files, etc. Let's assume you unzipped DJGPP into c:\djgpp.
<p>
<ul>
 <li>Add the c:\djgpp\bin directory to your PATH variable. For example, if you have "set PATH=c:\;c:\dos" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you would have to change it to "set PATH=c:\;c:\dos;c:\djgpp\bin".
<p>
<li>Set the DJGPP variable to point to the djgpp.env file. For example, add the line "set DJGPP=c:/djgpp/djgpp.env" to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<p>
<li>set TMPDIR=c:\yourtempdir (DJGPP needs some temp space while building) 
<p>
<li>set EMU=c:\djgpp\bin\emu387.dxe (if your CPU doesn't have a math coprocessor)
<p>
<li>set 387=n (add this if you're adding the previous line)
</ul>
