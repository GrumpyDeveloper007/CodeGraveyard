DJGPP v2 Setup Instructions

Important:

[*** ] All files should be unpacked by typing "pkunzip -d file.zip" or
"unzip file.zip."

V2.01 is available at simtelnet, among others. The files are distributed in
the following directories: v2/, v2gnu/ and v2misc/. For C development, you
need: (with their zip file sizes)

   * djdev201.zip - Development Kit and Runtime (1530K)
   * gcc2721b.zip - GCC 2.7.2.1 (1090K)
   * bnu27b.zip - GNU binutils 2.7 (1710K)
   * txi390b.zip - GNU texinfo 3.90 (438K)
   * csdpmi(1|2|3)b.zip - CWS's DPMI server (30-50K)

Additionally, for C++, these are also needed:

   * gpp2721b.zip - G++ 2.7.2.1 (680K)
   * lgp271b.zip - libg++ 2.7.1 (638K)

The following tools are highly recommended for C or C++ programming:

   * gdb416b.zip - GNU Debugger 4.16 (520K)
   * mak375b.zip - GNU Make 3.75 (209K)

Other things one might find useful:

   * djlsr201.zip - base library sources (1460K)
   * lgp271s.zip - libg++ 2.7.1 sources (970K)

In general, for v2, *b.zip are binaries (and docs), and *sr*.zip and *s.zip
are the sources.

[*** ] After unpacking the files into a directory, you need to set up a few
environment variables and make sure the compiler knows where to look for
important things such as standard include files, etc. Let's assume you
unzipped DJGPP into c:\djgpp.

   * Add the c:\djgpp\bin directory to your PATH variable. For example, if
     you have "set PATH=c:\;c:\dos" in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you would
     have to change it to "set PATH=c:\;c:\dos;c:\djgpp\bin".

   * Set the DJGPP variable to point to the djgpp.env file. For example,
     add the line "set DJGPP=c:/djgpp/djgpp.env" to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

   * set TMPDIR=c:\yourtempdir (DJGPP needs some temp space while building)

   * set EMU=c:\djgpp\bin\emu387.dxe (if your CPU doesn't have a math
     coprocessor)

   * set 387=n (add this if you're adding the previous line)

[*** ] The FAQ list has a complete list of other environment variables that
you might want to set to suit your specific needs.
