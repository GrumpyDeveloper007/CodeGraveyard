Version:
0.11 -2/15/2006

Description:
-Added support for hashtable (in and out)
-fixed int overloading
-Exceptions generated during (and around) method invocation will return an error (catchable in the onStatus callback)
 (exceptions generated during serialization/deserialization are thrown in-code, which typically results
  in a flash script error)
-Binding flag DeclaredOnly was added when searching for the method to invoke
-Output support for char (treated as string)
-When inputting a custom object the bytes are read and discarded, still have to figure out best way to deal
 with it. This is also true for typed objects.
